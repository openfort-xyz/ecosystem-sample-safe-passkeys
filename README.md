## Project Structure

Every Ecosystem Wallet consists of two main projects: the **Wallet SDK** and the **Wallet UI**.

- `wallet-sdk`: Makes your wallet discoverable to developers installing it. Can be published to a package manager like [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) for easy integration.
- `wallet-ui`: The user interface for the wallet, including pages for sending transactions, signing messages, managing session keys, and more.


## Wallet SDK

This directory contains the core SDK for interacting with your ecosystem wallet, making it discoverable to developers.

## Wallet UI

The Ecosystem Wallet is a complete solution for managing digital assets within the ecosystem:

- `frontend`: Contains the user interface for the wallet, including pages for sending transactions, signing messages, managing session keys, and more.
